If you have internal or extrnal certifications that you need to pass in your company, or a course that you need to learn quickly in order to pass the exams, the tools provided here will help you wih that. This site currently offers two tools, one is the question tool and other one is the quiz tool. \r\n\r\n#### Question Tool \r\n\r\nDemo: https://jboss7-undersun.rhcloud.com/question/welcome \r\n\r\nThis application would allow you to upload an excel file, sample is provided on this link \r\n\r\nThe excel file is a collection of questions with the corresponding answer, answer selections and explanation.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this application is to allow the user to memorize the answer for a specific question because the question is being prompted twice by default. \r\n\r\nFor example, in order to pass or finish 1 question, the user has to answer it twice. If the user answers it correctly at first try, and wrong at second, then the logic will ask the question twice again.\r\n\r\nThis tool allow the user to memorize the answer for certain questions. \r\n\r\nBy default, it has a queue for 8 questions, after the questions have been asked, if there are wrong answer selected, the user will be presented a screen to review the wrong answers. After this, it will start asking the question again. For example, if you have 16 questions, you will be asked 32 questions if you have answered all the question perfectly.\r\n\r\nIf not, the user will be stuck until the user have memorized all the answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Demo\r\n\r\nTry the demo to get a feel of how it worked. The demo is plain version of the application without the use of rest api as it is mostly done in jsp.\r\n\r\nhttps://jboss7-undersun.rhcloud.com/question/welcome\r\n\r\n#### Quiz Tool \r\n\r\nAfter undergoing the Question Tool, it is good to test what you hav learned. Upload the same file that you have used on Question Tool on the Quiz Tool. This tool will ask you all the question and check if you have answered everyting perfectly.\r\n\r\nhttps://jboss7-undersun.rhcloud.com/quiz/welcome\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\n\r\n#### How It Should Work using AngularJS\r\n\r\n1. Create a default page i.e. start.html\r\n2. Create the angular script on start.html \r\n\r\nThe first angular ajax script should be calling \"getFirstQuestion\"\r\n\r\nBelow is the POST call to this url.\r\n\r\nhttps://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/getFirstQuestion/{memberNumber}/inputFile\r\n\r\nThere are two inputs to be passed on this ajax call\r\n\r\na. memberNumber should be passed with random number (8 numbers)\r\nb. mulipart/encoded file upload. The field name is \"file\"\r\n\r\nBelow is the sample json response\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"question\": \"Which of the following is an example of a vulnerability?\",\r\n  \"selection\": {\r\n    \"d\": \"Unauthorized access to confidential resources\",\r\n    \"b\": \"Misconfigured server\",\r\n    \"c\": \"Virus infection\",\r\n    \"a\": \"Denial of service attack\"\r\n  },\r\n  \"questionNumber\": 8,\r\n  \"sessionId\": \"4a030e93-504f-4ff8-9e2c-420fccd5dff9\",\r\n  \"answer\": null,\r\n  \"explanation\": null,\r\n  \"questionBucketDetails\": {\r\n    \"questionNumber\": 8,\r\n    \"totalQuestionRunningValue\": 0,\r\n    \"totalQuestion\": 12,\r\n    \"numberOfSetsDone\": 1,\r\n    \"questionSetRunningValue\": 0,\r\n    \"questionSetTotalValue\": 8\r\n  },\r\n  \"status\": \"QUESTION_AVAILABLE\",\r\n  \"questionType\": \"single\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\nBased on quesiton type, you will create the answer selection as radio button or checkbox. If question type value is single, then it is a radio button. If multi-select, it should be checkbox.\r\n\r\nYou should layout the json response above like shown below:\r\n\r\nQuestion: sample question\r\n() Potato\r\n() Apple\r\n() Guava\r\n\r\nFor multi-select, it should be a check box\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion: sample question\r\n[] Potato\r\n[] Apple\r\n[] Guava\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the bottom of the question and answer selection, you will have two button.\r\n\r\n[Check Answer] [Next Question]\r\n\r\n3. The chek answer button would call the angular script that will call the checkanswer ajax\r\n\r\nYou will need to pass here the generated member number and the sessionId \r\n\r\nhttps://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/checkAnswer/{answer}/{sessionId}/{questionNumber}\r\n\r\nThe answer is also listed on the response from above, the answer should a or b or c ,etc for single question type. For question type that is 'multi', the answer should be delimited by comma, i.e. a,b,c or a,c\r\n\r\nBelow is the sample response. You should have to show it so that user can see it clearly.\r\n\r\n{\"answer\":\"Answer is correct\"}\r\n\r\nThe user will not be able to click the Next Button question until Check Answer button is clicked.\r\n\r\n4. Next Question button logic. Call the getNextQuestion api call\r\n\r\nhttps://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/getNextQuestion/1111/d26fc144-0468-4f43-bfd5-8c19617e0bfb\r\n\r\nFor this call, you only need to send the sessionId and the generated member number. You should get a same signature response. Remove the old question and answer from UI, and replace with this new question that you will get from this api call.\r\n\r\n5. Do the same logic on item 3.\r\n\r\n6. Try to use this demo on how things work until finishing up all question. https://jboss7-undersun.rhcloud.com/question/welcome\r\n\r\nYou have to take care of the status. If the status is saying no question available, then you should call the getWrongAnswer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSample:\r\n\r\nhttps://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/getWrongAnswer/1111/d26fc144-0468-4f43-bfd5-8c19617e0bfb\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"question\":\"\",\"selection\":{},\"questionNumber\":10,\"sessionId\":\"d26fc144-0468-4f43-bfd5-8c19617e0bfb\",\"answer\":\"NA\",\"explanation\":\"NA\",\"questionBucketDetails\":{\"questionNumber\":10,\"totalQuestionRunningValue\":0,\"totalQuestion\":10,\"numberOfSetsDone\":1,\"questionSetRunningValue\":1,\"questionSetTotalValue\":8},\"status\":\"STATUS_NULL_QUESTIONS_NOT_ANSWERED\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCreate a button here, [Review Answer] With this button, you would call getWrongAnswer until it is finish. Once done, you should see a different status. You should then call the getNextQuestion API again.\r\n\r\nYou should show the answer value and the explanation here. Try the demo. https://jboss7-undersun.rhcloud.com/question/welcome\r\n\r\nThe reason that we are showing the wrong answer is to show to the user the correct answer and its explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. This will be same process until all questions are finished. \r\n\r\n\r\n#### Development\r\n\r\n1. To be able to call the rest api, you should be creating your angular ajax script on this location\r\n\r\n\r\nquestion-application/tree/master/question-web/src/main/webapp\r\n\r\nClone the application from here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/mindelements/question-application\r\n\r\n2. If you dont know how to run this applicaton on eclipse, then I can provide access to github so that you can commit your code directly on github, and it will get deployed automatically on the server. Around 15-30 seconds.\r\n\r\nYou will see your output on this location after deployment\r\n\r\nhttps://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/mindelements-question-web/\r\n\r\nI recommend you to signup to github so that I can enable your account on this project.\r\n\r\n3. Look at the sample index.html and index2.html on this location:\r\n\r\nquestion-application/tree/master/question-web/src/main/webapp\r\n\r\n4. You dont have to setup a local web server on your desktop. Just clone the project using github for windows and commit once you're done. The build will run automatically.\r\n\r\n5. You have to create a design that will make this application usable in both mobile and desktop. \r\n\r\n6. If you know how to fork this project, that will be great. Fork it and create your change in your project and just send a pull request.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther Old Notes\r\n==========\r\n\r\nMain page\r\n\r\n* https://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/\r\n\r\nInitial REST POST call with file attachement\r\n\r\nPOST getFirstQuestion\r\n\r\n* https://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/getFirstQuestion/{memberNumber}/inputFile\r\n\r\nSample\r\n* https://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/getFirstQuestion/1111/inputFile\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"question\":\"What is ABC related for?\",\"selection\":{\"d\":\"TV\",\"b\":\"Space\",\"c\":\"Travel\",\"a\":\"Food\"},\"questionNumber\":2,\"sessionId\":\"d26fc144-0468-4f43-bfd5-8c19617e0bfb\",\"answer\":null,\"explanation\":null,\"questionBucketDetails\":{\"questionNumber\":2,\"totalQuestionRunningValue\":0,\"totalQuestion\":10,\"numberOfSetsDone\":1,\"questionSetRunningValue\":0,\"questionSetTotalValue\":8},\"status\":\"QUESTION_AVAILABLE\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet remaining question one by one\r\nGET getNextQuestion\r\n*https://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/getNextQuestion/{memberNumber}/{sessionId}\r\n\r\nSample\r\n*https://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/getNextQuestion/1111/d26fc144-0468-4f43-bfd5-8c19617e0bfb\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"question\":\"other question 7\",\"selection\":{\"d\":\"other answer d 7\",\"b\":\"other answer b 7\",\"c\":\"other answer c 7\",\"a\":\"other answer 7\"},\"questionNumber\":10,\"sessionId\":\"d26fc144-0468-4f43-bfd5-8c19617e0bfb\",\"answer\":null,\"explanation\":null,\"questionBucketDetails\":{\"questionNumber\":10,\"totalQuestionRunningValue\":0,\"totalQuestion\":10,\"numberOfSetsDone\":1,\"questionSetRunningValue\":1,\"questionSetTotalValue\":8},\"status\":\"QUESTION_AVAILABLE\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nCheck the answer for every question\r\n\r\nGET checkAnswer\r\n\r\n* https://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/checkAnswer/{answer}/{sessionId}/{questionNumber}\r\n\r\nSample\r\n\r\n* https://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/checkAnswer/a/1111/d26fc144-0468-4f43-bfd5-8c19617e0bfb/1\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"answer\":\"Answer is correct\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nGet the list of wrong answer one by one\r\n\r\nhttps://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/getWrongAnswer/{memberNumber}/{sessionId}\r\n\r\nSample:\r\n\r\nhttps://qa1-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-web/rest/questions/getWrongAnswer/1111/d26fc144-0468-4f43-bfd5-8c19617e0bfb\r\n\r\n```\r\n{\"question\":\"\",\"selection\":{},\"questionNumber\":10,\"sessionId\":\"d26fc144-0468-4f43-bfd5-8c19617e0bfb\",\"answer\":\"NA\",\"explanation\":\"NA\",\"questionBucketDetails\":{\"questionNumber\":10,\"totalQuestionRunningValue\":0,\"totalQuestion\":10,\"numberOfSetsDone\":1,\"questionSetRunningValue\":1,\"questionSetTotalValue\":8},\"status\":\"STATUS_NULL_QUESTIONS_NOT_ANSWERED\"}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSwagger Documentation\r\n==================\r\n\r\nCheck for QuestionBucket and AnswerBucket response json\r\n\r\n* https://portal-mindelements.rhcloud.com/question-rest/apidocs/#!/questions\r\n \r\n\r\nReal-time Development\r\n======================\r\n\r\nOnce code is committed or changed on github.
